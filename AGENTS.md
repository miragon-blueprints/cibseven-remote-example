# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working in this repo. This is the real file; `CLAUDE.md` just
imports it (see [ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-agents-md-as-the-single-source.md)).

## Project Overview

A **MiraVelo bike-leasing** example implemented against a **remote** CIB seven engine: the same BPMN
process the sibling engine blueprints implement, split across two Spring Boot apps and with an
enforced hexagonal architecture in the worker. There is **no frontend** — this is a headless
remote/external-task blueprint.

- **Engine host** (`service/engine-service`) — a generic, model-agnostic CIB seven 2.2.0 engine host
  on **:8081** (`/engine-rest` + Cockpit/Tasklist). It deploys no model; it only hosts the in-engine
  execution/task listener beans. Package root `io.miragon.blueprint`.
- **Worker** (`service/example-service`) — Spring Boot 4, hexagonal, on **:8082**. It owns
  the domain, use cases and adapters, **owns and deploys** the BPMN/DMN/form models, and drives the
  remote engine through the generated REST client. Service tasks are `camunda:type="external"`; the
  worker subscribes to their topics (`bikeLeasing.<task>`) via external-task workers under
  `adapter/inbound/cibseven`. Package root `io.miragon.blueprint`.
- **Generated engine client** (`service/common-cibseven-client`) — a typed `/engine-rest` client
  generated from CIB seven's official OpenAPI spec, pinned to the engine version so the two never
  drift. The worker uses it instead of hand-written HTTP calls.
- **Shared architecture tests** (`service/common-architecture-tests`) — the architecture rules the
  worker wires in.
  <!-- variant:blueprint -->
- **Two equivalent variants on `main`** — `kotlin-gradle/` (Kotlin, **the recommended stack**) and
  `java-maven/` (Java 21, for teams bound to it and for trainings). Each is self-contained: it holds
  all four modules and its own copy of the process models, forms, migrations and `application.yaml`;
  the `Blueprint Checks` workflow fails when the `src/main/resources` trees differ, so **edit a model in
  one variant and copy it to the other**. The variants must stay functionally identical: **make every
  change in behaviour in both variants in the same PR.** Changes that only concern one language's
  idioms stay on that side. See [ADR-0013](docs/adr/0013-two-stack-variants-side-by-side-on-main.md).
  The OpenAPI contract below is drift-gated against **both** variants.
  Stack-specific content in shared files (docs, Dependabot, Conductor settings) is wrapped in
  `variant:<name>` markers so `scripts/create-starter.sh` can strip it — see
  [docs/starter.md](docs/starter.md).
  <!-- /variant:blueprint -->
- **The worker's own API** is `openapi/openapi.json`: springdoc generates it from the controllers, it is
  **committed and drift-gated** (a test regenerates it during the build). See
  [ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-openapi-as-the-checked-in-contract.md).

```

## Development Setup

The remote topology is three processes — Postgres, then the engine host, then the worker (the worker
deploys its process into the engine at start-up, so the engine must be up first):

```bash
docker compose -f stack/docker-compose.yml up -d   # Postgres (creates bikeleasing_engine + bikeleasing_app)
```

<!-- variant:kotlin-gradle -->
```bash
cd kotlin-gradle && ./gradlew :service:engine-service:bootRun    # engine host + Cockpit on :8081
cd kotlin-gradle && ./gradlew :service:example-service:bootRun   # worker (REST + external-task workers) on :8082
```
<!-- /variant:kotlin-gradle -->
<!-- variant:java-maven -->
```bash
cd java-maven && ./mvnw -pl service/engine-service spring-boot:run        # engine host + Cockpit on :8081
cd java-maven && ./mvnw -pl service/example-service -am spring-boot:run   # worker (REST + external-task workers) on :8082
```
<!-- /variant:java-maven -->

## Architecture — the rules are machine-enforced

The worker's hexagonal rules live in `service/common-architecture-tests` (ArchUnit, plus a
source-level tool for the rules bytecode cannot express) and **fail the build** — one line wires them
into the worker (`ArchitectureTest` extends `ServiceArchitectureTest`). See
[ADR-0007](docs/adr/0007-two-architecture-test-tools-archunit-and-konsist.md). Read
`HexagonalArchitectureTest` and `NamingConventionArchitectureTest` before writing code. The hard rules:

- **One inbound port per controller/worker.** `onlyFulfilOneUseCase` counts constructor params in
  `application.port.inbound` and fails at >1.
- **No new top-level `config` package** in the worker. The containment rule ignores only *direct*
  members of the root package, so `io.miragon.blueprint.config` would fail. Cross-cutting
  `@Configuration` (CORS, OpenAPI, error handling) goes in `adapter.inbound.rest` — the
  `Configuration` suffix is whitelisted there.
- **Suffixes:** inbound port `UseCase|Query`; outbound `Port|Repository|Process`; service
  `Service|Configuration`; `adapter.inbound.rest` `Controller|Dto|Input|Mapper|Configuration`;
  `adapter.outbound` `PersistenceAdapter|Adapter|Mapper|Entity|Repository`.
- **Spring Data types stop at the adapter.** Ports own their own `Filter`/`Page`/`Criteria` types.
- **External-task workers** live under `adapter/inbound/cibseven`, subscribe by topic, and extend
  `BaseExternalTaskWorker`. They are inbound adapters — the same one-use-case rule applies.

## BPMN Quality Gates

- The worker **owns** the `.bpmn`/`.dmn`/`.form` models under
  `service/example-service/src/main/resources` and deploys them into the remote engine at start-up.
- `bpmn-to-code` generates the typed process API into the worker's `process` package — never
  hand-edit `*ProcessApi` or the shared `ServiceTasks`/`Messages`/`ProcessVariables`/`Errors`/
  `Escalations` files; edit the `.bpmn` and regenerate. Since bpmn-to-code 6 the API is node-centric:
  `<Process>ProcessApi.FlowNodes.<Node>` carries the element (its id and `ELEMENT_ID`), its
  `Variables` and its successors (`Next`). Process tests assert the walked path as a compile-checked
  path over these nodes instead of hand-maintained element-id lists.
- `bpmn-to-code-testing` validates the models structurally at build time — including a custom rule
  that every service task must be an **external task with a topic**.
- `bpmnlint` runs on staged `.bpmn` via `.githooks/pre-commit` (install: `npm run hooks:install`).

## Testing

TDD. Match the test style to the layer:

| Layer | Test style |
|---|---|
| domain | plain unit tests |
| application service | unit tests with mocked ports |
| `adapter.inbound.rest` | `@WebMvcTest` with the use case mocked |
| `adapter.inbound.cibseven` (external-task workers) | direct unit tests with mocks |
| `adapter.outbound.db` | `@DataJpaTest` |
| `adapter.outbound.engine` (remote client) | `MockRestServiceServer` |
| process end-to-end | CIB seven process tests (`cibseven-bpm-assert`, in-memory engine), paths asserted against the generated API |

**Mutation testing gates PRs at 80**: a test that executes without asserting will fail CI. Coverage
says a line ran; mutation says a test would have noticed. The PR gate runs **diff-scoped** (only the
classes the PR changed, still blocking); the **full-module** gate-80 sweep runs nightly. See
[ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-mutation-testing-as-a-blocking-pr-gate.md).

## Verify After Each Task (targeted, not a full build)

<!-- variant:blueprint -->
Verify the variant you touched — which, for a change in behaviour, is both.
<!-- /variant:blueprint -->

<!-- variant:kotlin-gradle -->
In `kotlin-gradle/`:

- Worker service/controller: `./gradlew :service:example-service:test --tests "*<Name>Test"`
- Architecture only: `./gradlew :service:example-service:test --tests "io.miragon.blueprint.architecture.*"`
  <!-- /variant:kotlin-gradle -->

<!-- variant:java-maven -->
In `java-maven/`:

- Worker service/controller: `./mvnw -pl service/example-service -am test -Dtest="<Name>Test" -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false`
- Architecture only: `./mvnw -pl service/example-service -am test -Dtest="ArchitectureTest" -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false`
  <!-- /variant:java-maven -->

From the repo root:

- Contract changed: regenerate the spec, then `git diff --exit-code openapi/openapi.json`
- Process changed: regenerate the process API, then the `process.*` tests

## Working with GitHub

Use the `gh` CLI. Write everything (issues, PRs, commit messages) in **English**. Use
**Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `ci:`, `build:`).

## ADRs

Architecture decisions are recorded in `docs/adr/`. Read them to understand *why* the repo is shaped
this way before proposing structural changes.

## Personality

You are a knowledgeable colleague, not someone who passively takes orders. If something proposed
doesn't look right, suggest corrections, ask critical questions, and push back where needed.
Challenge ideas that could benefit from further improvement or iterative refinement rather than just
accepting them at face value.
