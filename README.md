# CIB seven Remote Bike-Leasing Blueprint

A solution template to fork for automating a business process on [CIB seven](https://cibseven.org)
(the community fork of Camunda 7) with a **remote engine** and Spring Boot. The engine runs as a
generic host, while a separate worker owns the process: it deploys the model and runs all service-task
logic as external tasks over the engine's REST API. It is still a work in progress.

## Pick your stack

| | [`kotlin-gradle/`](kotlin-gradle/README.md) | [`java-maven/`](java-maven/README.md) |
|---|---|---|
| **Stack** | Kotlin 2.4 · Gradle | Java 21 · Maven |
| **Choose it when** | you are free to choose — **our recommendation** | Java + Maven is your standard, or you are in a training |

Both run the same process behind the same REST contract; CI keeps their models and configuration
identical. Building on one? [Turn the repo into a single-stack starter](docs/starter.md).

## The process

![The bike-leasing process](docs/assets/bike-leasing.png)

**MiraVelo** is a fictional bike brand that sells on a leasing model. The service takes a leasing
application from the first request to an active lease and deliberately covers the BPMN elements you
meet in real processes: message start, service tasks run as external tasks by the worker and a DMN
rule, an embedded sub-process with an event-based gateway and reminder timer, a parallel fork/join, a
user task with a Camunda Form, execution and task listeners running inside the engine, compensation
guarded by error and escalation events, a call activity, a withdrawal event sub-process and a
terminate end event.

## Quick start

Requires JDK 21 and Docker or Podman; start the engine host before the worker, which deploys the process into it.

```bash
docker compose -f stack/docker-compose.yml up -d   # Postgres on :5432
# variant:kotlin-gradle
cd kotlin-gradle && ./gradlew :service:engine-service:bootRun    # engine host on :8081
cd kotlin-gradle && ./gradlew :service:example-service:bootRun   # worker on :8082, in a second shell
# /variant:kotlin-gradle
# variant:java-maven
cd java-maven && ./mvnw -pl service/engine-service spring-boot:run        # engine host on :8081
cd java-maven && ./mvnw -pl service/example-service -am spring-boot:run   # worker on :8082, in a second shell
# /variant:java-maven
```
