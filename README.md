# CIB seven Remote Bike-Leasing Blueprint

> [!NOTE]
> **🚧 Work in progress.** A **solution template** to fork and build on — not a product that ships.
> Expect it to keep evolving.

A ready-to-fork **starting point** for automating a business process on
[CIB seven](https://cibseven.org) (the community fork of Camunda 7) with a **remote engine** and
Spring Boot. The engine runs as a generic host, while a separate worker **owns the process**: it
deploys the model into the engine and runs all service-task logic as **external tasks** over the
engine's REST API.

## 🧭 Pick your stack

| | [`kotlin-gradle/`](kotlin-gradle/README.md) | [`java-maven/`](java-maven/README.md) |
|---|---|---|
| **Stack** | Kotlin 2.4 · Gradle | Java 21 · Maven |
| **Choose it when** | you are free to choose — **our recommendation for a modern stack** | Java + Maven is your team's or company's standard, or you are in a training |

Both run the same process, expose the same REST contract and pass the same end-to-end scenarios. Each
directory is self-contained — build, engine host, worker, process models and schema — and CI keeps the
models and configuration of the two identical, so only the language and the build tool differ. Building
on one? [Turn the repo into a single-stack starter](docs/starter.md) with one command.

## 🚲 The scenario

**MiraVelo** is a (fictional) bike brand that sells on a **leasing model**. This service automates a
leasing application from the first request to an active lease — and deliberately walks through the
**broad palette of BPMN elements you meet in real processes**, not just a happy-path service task:

![The bike-leasing process](docs/assets/bike-leasing.png)

- **message start event**, **service tasks** (run as external tasks by the worker) and a **DMN
  business-rule task**
- **embedded sub-process** with an **event-based gateway** and a non-interrupting **reminder timer**
- **parallel fork/join**, and a **user task with a Camunda Form** — completable in the Tasklist or via REST
- **execution** and **task listeners**, which — unlike the service tasks — run inside the engine
- **compensation / SAGA** handlers guarded by **error** and **escalation** boundary events
- **call activity**, **message event sub-process** (withdrawal) and a **terminate end event**

## 🚀 Run it

You need **JDK 21** and **Docker** (or Podman). The stack is three processes: Postgres, the engine
host and the worker. The worker deploys its process into the engine at start-up, so start the engine
first.

**1. Start Postgres**

```bash
docker compose -f stack/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

**2. Start the engine host** on :8081

<!-- variant:kotlin-gradle -->
```bash
cd kotlin-gradle && ./gradlew :service:engine-service:bootRun
```
<!-- /variant:kotlin-gradle -->
<!-- variant:blueprint -->
or
<!-- /variant:blueprint -->
<!-- variant:java-maven -->
```bash
cd java-maven && ./mvnw -pl service/engine-service spring-boot:run
```
<!-- /variant:java-maven -->

**3. Start the worker** on :8082, in a second shell

<!-- variant:kotlin-gradle -->
```bash
cd kotlin-gradle && ./gradlew :service:example-service:bootRun
```
<!-- /variant:kotlin-gradle -->
<!-- variant:blueprint -->
or
<!-- /variant:blueprint -->
<!-- variant:java-maven -->
```bash
cd java-maven && ./mvnw -pl service/example-service -am spring-boot:run
```
<!-- /variant:java-maven -->

**4. Use it** — open the Cockpit / Tasklist at <http://localhost:8081/camunda> (admin/admin) or the
Swagger UI at <http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html>, or drive the whole process over REST:

```bash
cd bruno && npx --yes @usebruno/cli@4.0.0 run . --env local -r
```
