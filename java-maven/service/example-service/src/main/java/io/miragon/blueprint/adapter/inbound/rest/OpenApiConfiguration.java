/**
 * OpenAPI metadata for the customer-portal / back-office contract this worker serves at
 * {@code /v3/api-docs}. That contract is committed at {@code openapi/openapi.json} and consumed by any API
 * client (see docs/adr/0003); the engine-internal {@code /engine-rest} API is a separate concern owned by
 * the engine-service and driven here through the generated client, not re-exposed.
 *
 * <p>This is cross-cutting web configuration and lives in {@code adapter.inbound.rest}, NOT in a separate
 * {@code config} package — the architecture tests ignore only direct members of the root package, so a
 * new {@code io.miragon.blueprint.config} package would fail the suite. The {@code Configuration} suffix is
 * whitelisted for this package in {@code NamingConventionArchitectureTest}.
