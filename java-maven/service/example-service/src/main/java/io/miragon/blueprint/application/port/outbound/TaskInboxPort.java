 * Reads open user tasks from the process engine's task list. Kept deliberately thin: it returns only

 * back-office resolves a clarification through the domain ({@code POST .../clarify-alternative}), which
 * correlates by business key — so the UI never needs, and can never misuse, a raw task id.
