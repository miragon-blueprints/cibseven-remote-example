 * Lifecycle of a leasing application, mirrored from the process:

 * the bike is handed to the customer (waiting-period token), {@link #ACTIVE} when the leasing is live
 * after the withdrawal period elapses. {@link #WITHDRAWN} is the in-progress cancellation state: the
 * customer has withdrawn and the compensation runs asynchronously (it may park on a return-clarification
 * task) before it reaches the terminal {@link #CANCELLED}. {@link #REJECTED} and {@link #CANCELLED} are
 * the terminal negative outcomes.
