/**
 * Seeds MiraVelo's bike catalogue on start-up so the submit form's picker is never empty and the
 * Bruno / Playwright scenarios always find their ids. Idempotent — `save` upserts by id.
 *
 * `BIKE-OOS` is seeded deliberately: it is the dealer's out-of-stock bike, so selecting it from the
 * UI drives the bike-unavailable → alternative-selection scenario end to end. Availability itself is
 * decided by the dealer, not stored here.
 *
 * It lives in the root package next to the application class — application bootstrap, outside the
 * hexagonal layers — and is excluded from mutation testing for the same reason.
