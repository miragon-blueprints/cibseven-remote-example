/**
 * Example {@link ExecutionListener} on the {@code serviceTask_orderBike} service task, wired via
 * {@code camunda:executionListener event="end" delegateExpression="#{bikeOrderAuditListener}"} in the BPMN.
 * It fires <em>after</em> the external {@code orderBike} worker has completed the task and can read the result
 * variables that worker returned, so it simply audit-logs the outcome.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it lives in {@code engine-service}, not the worker:</b> unlike a service task, an execution listener
 * has no external-task equivalent — it always runs <em>inside</em> the engine, so the generic host carries the
 * bean (referenced by expression, {@code #{bikeOrderAuditListener}}). The engine deliberately does not depend
 * on the worker, so it has no access to the worker's generated {@code *ProcessApi} — the variable names below
 * are therefore plain string constants that must stay in sync with the model by hand. A production
 * listener could route through a use case instead of logging.
