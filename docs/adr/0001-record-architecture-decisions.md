# 0001 — Record architecture decisions

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-18

## Context

This repository is a **blueprint** — a starting point meant to be forked and made your own. Its value
is not only the working code but the *reasoning* behind its shape: why the worker is hexagonal, why
the process contract lives in the worker, why the engine client is generated from CIB seven's official
OpenAPI spec. That reasoning normally lives in people's heads and pull-request threads, where a new
contributor (human or AI agent) cannot find it and where it decays as the team changes.

## Decision

We record architecturally significant decisions as **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**, following
Michael Nygard's format, one Markdown file per decision under `docs/adr/`, numbered sequentially from
`0001`. Each record captures Status, Context, Decision, and Consequences. New records are copied from
[`0000-adr-template.md`](0000-adr-template.md) and never renumbered; a superseded decision is marked
`Deprecated`/`Superseded by` rather than deleted, so the history stays legible.

An ADR is committed **in the same commit** as the code it explains, so the decision and its
implementation are traceable together in `git` history.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** a forker inherits the *why*, not just the *what*; agents can read the constraints
  before touching code; decisions are reviewable in PRs like any other change.
- **Negative / trade-offs:** a small discipline cost — a real decision now means writing a paragraph.
- **Neutral:** `docs/adr/` becomes the canonical index of cross-cutting decisions; each ADR carries
  its own detail in its Decision section rather than delegating to a separate long-form guide.
