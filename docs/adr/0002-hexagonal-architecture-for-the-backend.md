# 0002 — Hexagonal architecture for the backend

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-18

## Context

The worker automates a real BPMN process with many collaborators: a **remote** process engine, JPA
persistence, a simulated dealer, notification and contract stubs. If controllers, external-task
workers, and the engine client call each other freely, business logic leaks into infrastructure and
the process becomes untestable in isolation. A blueprint has to demonstrate a structure that stays
sane as this fan-out grows — and it has to make that structure *checkable*, not merely documented, so
a forker (or an AI agent) cannot quietly erode it.

## Decision

We structure `service/example-service` as a **hexagon (ports & adapters)** under `io.miragon.blueprint`:

- `domain/` — pure Kotlin value objects and aggregates; no framework imports.
- `application/port/inbound` — one **`*UseCase`** (state-changing) or **`*Query`** (read) interface per
  operation. `application/port/outbound` — **`*Repository` / `*Port` / `*Process`** interfaces.
- `application/service` — one `*Service` implementing exactly one inbound port; it may not call another
  service or any inbound port.
- `adapter/inbound/{rest,cibseven}` — driving adapters (REST controllers, and the external-task workers
  that subscribe to the engine's BPMN topics).
- `adapter/outbound/{db,engine,dealer,notification,contract,insurance}` — driven adapters, including the
  `engine` adapter that deploys the model and drives the remote engine over `/engine-rest`.
- `process/` — the **generated** `*ProcessApi` (bpmn-to-code: topics, messages, element ids, variables);
  a technical seam that fits neither side of the split.

These rules are **enforced by the reusable ArchUnit + Konsist suite** in
`service/common-architecture-tests`, wired into every module's tests so `./gradlew build` fails on a
violation:

- `HexagonalArchitectureTest` — the layered-dependency graph (domain depends on nothing; ports are
  interfaces; an in-adapter offers exactly one use-case; out-adapters never touch inbound ports).
- `NamingConventionArchitectureTest` — the suffix rules per package (`Controller`, `Worker`,
  `PersistenceAdapter`, `UseCase`, `Query`, …).
- There is deliberately **no `config` package**; Spring configuration lives beside the adapter it
  configures.
- The generated `process/` package is **explicitly excluded** from both suites — it is machine-written
  and does not follow the hand-written conventions.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** business logic is engine- and framework-agnostic and unit-testable behind ports; the
  structure is a *fitness function*, not a style guide — agents get instant, local feedback.
- **Negative / trade-offs:** more indirection (a port + a service + an adapter per operation) than a
  layered CRUD app; the "one use-case per adapter" rule means many small classes.
- **Neutral:** the generated-code seam (`process/`) is a permanent, documented exception, analogous to
  the generated engine client in
  [ADR-0003](0003-openapi-as-the-checked-in-contract.md).
