# 0004 — Mutation testing as a blocking PR gate

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-05

## Context

Line coverage answers "was this line executed?", not "would a test notice if the code broke?". That
gap matters most for **AI-assisted tests**, which reliably chase coverage while writing weak assertions
(assert-not-null instead of assert-a-value). A blueprint that invites agents to generate tests needs a
gate that grades *assertion strength*, not just execution. Mutation testing is inherently slower than
unit tests, though, so the gate must stay a guardrail, not a tollbooth — it must not become the thing
that stalls merges.

## Decision

We run **PIT (pitest)** as a **blocking gate** with `mutationThreshold = 80`, configured
(`pitest-maven`) in `service/example-service/pom.xml` and run via
`./mvnw -pl service/example-service -am test-compile pitest:mutationCoverage`.

- **On PRs it runs diff-scoped.** `.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml` computes the worker `*.java` files
  the PR changed (from `pull_request.base.sha`), maps them to `io.miragon.blueprint.<pkg>.<File>*`, and
  passes them to pitest via `-DtargetClasses`. It blocks the PR on the changed classes' score
  but stays off the critical path, and is skipped when a PR touches no worker code.
- **Nightly runs the full sweep.** `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` mutates the whole
  `io.miragon.blueprint.*` module with no property override — the authoritative gate-80 run — and
  uploads the HTML report as an artifact.
- Both runs **exclude noise**: the generated `*ProcessApi`, the Spring bootstrap and demo seeding, and
  the `adapter.inbound.cibseven.*` external-task workers (thin glue exercised only by the slow engine
  tests).
- The **kill-set** is the fast Mockito / `@WebMvcTest` / `@DataJpaTest` unit tests; the engine
  integration tests and the ArchUnit tests (`architecture.*`) are excluded from the kill-set —
  they'd make every run slow and non-deterministic without adding mutation signal.

**Why 80 and not 100:** PIT mutates JVM bytecode, and some mutants are *equivalent* — no test can
kill them (a mutated log guard, a defensive branch the types already rule out). 100% would push
contributors into asserting on noise or excluding code; 80 is a bar every PR can meet honestly while
still failing any test that executes code without checking its effect.

**What a weak test looks like:** a test that asserts too few of a DTO's fields — PIT blanks the
unasserted ones (`return ""`) and every test stays green; and a test that exercises only one branch of a
boolean — the *"always return true"* mutant is then *equivalent* to the original. Both are fixed by
asserting **every** mapped field and **both** outcomes of each branch — one assertion per outcome, not
per method.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** AI-generated tests are graded on whether they'd catch a real fault; weak assertions
  surface as surviving mutants with per-mutant, inline feedback — at PR time, on the code the PR
  changed.
- **Negative / trade-offs:** mutation testing is slower than unit tests, hence the diff-scoped PR run
  and the separate nightly full sweep. Gate-80 over a single changed class is stricter granularity than
  over the module, so a PR touching only a small class with a few surviving mutants can dip below 80
  (fix: assert every field and both branches, or exclude the class).
- **Neutral:** the module currently scores above the bar, so raising it is an open option; the threshold
  stays at 80 until it is deliberately revisited.

## Implementation notes

- `service/example-service/pom.xml` defaults pitest-maven's own `targetClasses` property to
  `io.miragon.blueprint.*` (full-module scope, used by the nightly sweep and local runs; CI overrides it
  with `-DtargetClasses=…`) and sets `failWhenNoMutations = false` so a PR whose changed classes are all
  excluded/non-mutable doesn't fail the build.
- `skipPitest` is `true` in the root `pom.xml` and `false` only in the worker, so the reactor run (`-am`
  builds the sibling modules the worker needs) mutates only the worker. `pitest:mutationCoverage` does
  not compile, hence the `test-compile` in front of it; the report lands in
  `service/example-service/target/pit-reports`.
- PIT runs one worker thread per CPU: `build-helper-maven-plugin:cpu-count` sets `cpu.count` in
  `initialize` (override with `-Dcpu.count=N`).
- Do **not** rename the `Mutation testing (PIT, gate 80)` job in `pre-merge.yml` — it is the
  branch-protection required check.
