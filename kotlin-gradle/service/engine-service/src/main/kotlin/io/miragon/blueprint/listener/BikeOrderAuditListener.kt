/**
 * Example [ExecutionListener] on the `serviceTask_orderBike` service task, wired via
 * `camunda:executionListener event="end" delegateExpression="#{bikeOrderAuditListener}"` in the BPMN.
 * It fires *after* the external `orderBike` worker has finished the task and can read the result
 * variable that worker returned, so it simply audit-logs the outcome. No `orderId` means the worker
 * left the task through the `bikeUnavailable` BPMN error.
 *
 * **Why it lives in `engine-service`, not the worker:** unlike a service task, an execution listener
 * has no external-task equivalent — it always runs *inside* the engine, so the generic host carries the
 * bean (referenced by expression, `#{bikeOrderAuditListener}`). The engine deliberately does not depend
 * on the worker, so it has no access to the worker's generated `*ProcessApi` — the variable name below
 * is therefore a plain string constant that must stay in sync with the model by hand. A production
 * listener could route through a use case instead of logging.
